Description: An R6 interface for writing, validating, and parsing Vega-Lite JSON specifications. It provides
    the advantage of building specs in a concise notation without abstracting too far away
    from the underlying Vega-Lite JSON syntax. Parsing a specification generates the corresponding visualisation
    as an htmlwidget.
Imports:
  htmlwidgets, jsonlite, R6, V8
